I’m a Computer Science & Engineering graduate from _[Amity University Noida](https://www.amity.edu)_, passionate about Linux, open-source technologies, and software development. I love building tools, experimenting with systems, and contributing to meaningful tech communities.

I’m a two-time _[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com)_ contributor under __Automotive Grade Linux (AGL), a The Linux Foundation project__, where I developed Qt-based applications to simulate CAN Bus signals. I also interned as an SDE at _[FOSSEE, IIT Bombay](https://fossee.in)_, contributing to the eSim platform, a free and open-source EDA tool, where I worked on installer tooling and Flatpak packaging.

Currently, I work as a Global Technical Support Engineer at _[Ciena](https://www.ciena.com)_, where I handle network configuration, triage issues and troubleshoot on Linux environments, and provide support for Network Management Systems.

Outside of tech, I enjoy playing guitar, football, table tennis, and diving into science fiction and new discoveries.
