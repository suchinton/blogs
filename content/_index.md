I am thrilled to have you here and excited to share my journey with you. My name is Suchinton Chakravarty, and I am a participant of the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) 2023 program.

Through the next few months, I will be working on a Qt5 Application to Visualize/ Simulate CAN bus traffic using Kuksa.val with Automotive Grade Linux ([AGL](https://www.automotivelinux.org/)), a project hosted by [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/). 

On this blog, you will find weekly updates highlighting my progress and experiences while working on my project for GSoC. I hope you find something valuable and exciting here and feel free to contact me via the provided links for queries and suggestions.

Thank you for stopping by and I look forward to sharing my progress with you!
