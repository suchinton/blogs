# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

**Welcome to my Blog Post Website!**

I am thrilled to have you here and excited to share my journey with you. My name is Suchinton Chakravarty, and I am a participant of the Google Summer of Code 2023 program.

Throughout the next few months, I will be working on a [Qt5 Application to Visualize/ Simulate CAN bus traffic using Kuksa.val](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11OmvODP7dm9vrl1BYE7_ozr2PlSqGJz0HKZz2WtYFQc/edit?usp=sharing) with Automotive Grade Linux ([AGL](https://www.automotivelinux.org/)), a project hosted by [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects). AGL is a collaborative open-source project that aims to build a fully functional automotive platform that can serve as the de facto standard for the industry.

I cannot wait to share my progress with you. By reading my weekly blog posts, you can follow along with me as I tackle the challenges and triumphs that come with GSoC.

Thank you for stopping by and I look forward to sharing my progress with you!
