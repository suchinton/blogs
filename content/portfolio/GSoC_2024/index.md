## What is GSoC?

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program that offers students an opportunity to contribute to open-source projects. The program is sponsored by Google and has been running since 2005. The program aims to bring together students and open-source organizations to work on real-world projects. The program has three phases: the community bonding period, the coding period, and the final evaluation period.

## What is The Linux Foundation and Automotive Grade Linux?

[The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) is a nonprofit consortium dedicated to fostering the growth of Linux. [Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.automotivelinux.org/) is an open-source project hosted by The Linux Foundation that is building an open operating system and framework for automotive applications.

## My work

The objective of this project was to develop a Qt5 application that simulates CAN bus traffic using Kuksa.val to integrate with the AGL Demo platform. The application developed allows the end-users to emit signals using the kuksa-client SDK and Python-can to visualize and interact with AGL Demo applications, such as the IC, IVI, HVAC, and the Green Machine, that display CAN data through Kuksa.val.
