## What is FOSSEE?

FOSSEE is a project developed at IIT Bombay that promotes the use of FLOSS tools in academia and research. The project is funded by the National Mission on Education through ICT, Ministry of Education, Government of India. FOSSEE supports various FLOSS tools such as Scilab, Python, eSim, OpenFOAM, DWSIM, R, OpenModelica and more.

## My wrok

1. **Flatpak_Test_App (FOSSEE_Installer_Test):** A proof of concept application, implemented using Qt5 and Flatpak Sandboxing. It provides features to: 
    - Install python3 packages (Using the pip) in the user space
    - Extract binaries and libraries from pre-compiled packages
    - Compile packages from source and install them in the user space

1. **eSim-Tool-Manager:** It works to resolve various eSim dependencies, such as KiCad, Ngspice, Verilator,
Makerchip, GHDL, and OpenModelica by installing them as modules based on the user's preferences/ use cases. My work focused on adding general Linux support to the tool and writing install scripts for the various modules.
