<strong>Google Summer of Code (GSoC)</strong> is a global program by Google that offers students and new contributors the opportunity to work on open-source projects with mentoring from established organizations.

<strong>Automotive Grade Linux (AGL)</strong> is a collaborative open-source project under The Linux Foundation, aiming to build a unified software platform for in-vehicle infotainment and other automotive applications.

I <strong>Contributed to the Open-source Automotive Grade Linux</strong> project for <strong>two consecutive years (2023 and 2024)</strong> as a GSoC contributor. 
<ul>
  <li>Developed a Qt6/QML-based application to simulate and playback CAN bus signals, using multi-threading and design-pattern concepts.</li>
  <li>Collaborating with CIS and new contributors to add new features</li>
  <li>Utilized the Kuksa-client SDK and CAN frame messages to communicate with kuksa-val-server & Databroker over ethernet/LAN and CAN bus interface</li>
  <li>Built AGL Images using Yocto tools, tested against virtual machines and on-target hardware</li>
  <li>Added support for real-time and playback of CARLA - the car simulator (Unreal Engine).</li>
</ul>

FOSSEE is an <strong>IIT Bombay initiative promoting open-source software</strong> in education and research.
<strong>eSim</strong>, developed under FOSSEE, is a free EDA tool for circuit design, simulation, and PCB layout.
It integrates open tools like KiCad and Ngspice, offering an alternative to proprietary EDA software.
FOSSEE also conducts training to support eSim adoption in academic and engineering communities.
<ul>
  <li>Developed a Flatpak-based demo application to install eSim tools and dependencies.</li>
  <li>Ul improvements to eSim to show the progress of ongoing simulations.</li>
  <li>Submitted an Appimage application to install verilator from source and implemented initial port of Qt5 to Qt6.</li>
<ul>
